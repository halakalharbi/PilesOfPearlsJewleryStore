      <h3> <span class="dot"></span> How Do I Clean My Pearl Ring? </h3>
      <br>
      <p>Your hands come into contact with dirt, grime, oils, and chemicals throughout the day. It is important to clean
        your pearl rings regularly to make sure these things don&rsquo;t damage them. While your ring may have gold and
        diamonds too, that are much harder, let the pearl dictate how gently you need to handle it. Don&rsquo;t immerse
        it in
        water or harsh chemical cleaning agents. Instead, use a soft cloth that doesn&rsquo;t shed lint and gently wipe
        it
        down. If your pearl has a small stain or smudge, dampen a tiny edge of your cloth and use it to wipe the stained
        bit. Then pat the pearl dry. Don&rsquo;t use ultrasonic jewelry cleaners to clean your ring; they can damage the
        delicate structure of the pearl. Remember, your pearl ring should be the last accessory on and the first off.
        Always slide it on after applying your makeup, hairspray, sunscreen, and perfume.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> <span class="dot"></span> How Should I Store My Pearl Ring?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Pearls need moisture to keep them from drying out and getting brittle. So don&rsquo;t store a pearl ring in an
        airtight packet, which will surely damage it over the long run. Instead, use a jewelry box or pouch lined with
        fabric. Do not put your pearl ring along with other jewelry that could rub against it and damage or scratch it.
        Lastly, do not keep your pearl ring in storage for too long. Bring it out and wear it, allowing it to breathe.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3><span class="dot"></span> Can I Wear My Pearl Ring in The Shower?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>No. A Don&rsquo;t get your pearl ring wet under any circumstances. Always remove it before
        you shower, swim, do the dishes, or water the plants. Else, you may damage the adhesive between the pearl and
        the shank. The pearl may also get chipped and stripped of its natural luster. While you&rsquo;re at it,
        don&rsquo;t cook
        wearing your pearl ring. The extremes of acids and alkalines, heat and cold can get to it.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><span class="dot"></span> How Long Do Pearls Last?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>With adequate care and precaution, pearl rings can last a lifetime and be passed down generations. Durability
        also depends on the quality of pearl nacre.</p>

<br>
      <h3><span class="dot"></span> Can a Pearl Ring Be Worn Every Day?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Pearl rings are supposed to be worn and not tucked in at the back of your jewelry wardrobe forever. But pearls
        are occasional wear. They are the best accessory to accentuate formal and fine looks.</p>
